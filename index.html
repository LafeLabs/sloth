    <h1>SLOTH</h1>

<p>
 Sloth is a Maryland-based art collective who uses a combination of the sloth ethos and the sloth aesthetic to create and share sloth-related art using network infrastructure from waste streams.  On a sloth server, we put images of sloth related art in the "sloths" folder and it appears below.  To add art, send your sloth art to the Operator of this server, linked below.  Sloth is also works with AI based art to create new worlds of imagination from sloths.  As we scale up we will deploy sloth-art-generating AI to trash-based servers.
